``````{admonition} Exercises 
:class: attention 

**Exercise 1**: 
Here are a few practice exercises decoding station weather plots.

**Exercise 2**: Search the web for maps that show where weather observations
are made today (or recently).
 
**Exercise 3**: Search the web for satellite loops that cover your location.
Compare these images with the weather you see out the window, and make a
short-term forecast based on the satellite loop.

**Exercise 4**: Search the web to find the most recent set of visible, IR,
and water-vapor images that covers your area. Download these images; label cloud
areas as (a), (b), etc.; and interpret the clouds in those images. For the
cloud area directly over you, compare you satellite interpretation with the
view out your window.

**Exercise 5**: What shade of grey would the following clouds appear in
visible, IR, and water-vapor satellite images, and what pattern or shape
would they have in the images?
- jet contrail
- two cloud layers: cirrus & altostratus
- two cloud layers: cirrus & stratus
- three cloud layers: cirrus, altostratus, stratus e. two cloud layers: fog and altostratus
- altocumulus standing lenticular
- altocumulus castellanus
- billow clouds
- fumulus
- volcanic ash clouds

**Exercise 6**: Monitor the weather maps on the web every day for a week or
more over Europe. Identify the low centers and fronts. Discuss the variety of
arrangements of warm, cold, and occluded front that you observe.

**Exercise 7**: Use a sequence of weather maps every 6 or 12 h for a week, where each map is spanning a large portion of the globe. Finde one or more locations that exhibits the following mechanism for formation of a surface high pressure:
- global circulation
- monsoon
- Rossby wave
- thunderstorm
- topographic

**Exercise 8**: For a weather situation of relatively zonal flow from west to
east over Europe, access upper air soundings for weather stations in a line
more-or-less along the wind direction. Show how the sounding evolves as the air
flows over the continent.

**Exercise 9**: Same as previous exercise, but identify the frontal inversions
(or frontal stable layers) aloft in the sounding.

**Exercise 10**: Identify a region with high CAPE and look at the nearest
station with an upper air sounding. Create a skew-T diagram and determine the
LCL, LFC and CAPE.

**Exercise 11**: Why are there no extratropical cyclone tracks from east to west?

**Exercise 12**: Search the internet for satellite images of an air mass
thunderstorm. Do this for visible, IR, and water vapor channels. Discuss the
features of you resulting images.

# Setup the Jupyter Notebook environment

The materials provided are based on so-called Jupyter notebooks. You have
several possibilities to use the notebooks. You need a Jupyter environment that
allows you to use the notebooks. The following options are possible:

- [Local installation of Jupyter](local_install)
- [Jupyterhub on the CMS Server of the HU Berlin](jupyterhub)
- [Launch into interactive computing interfaces](launch_env)

After the installation, further Python packages must be installed in order to
be able to carry out all exercises. The most important packages are: 

- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)
- [xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/)
- [MetPy](https://unidata.github.io/MetPy/latest/index.html)


(local_install)=
## Local installation

Local installation means that each computer is running the software that
includes the Jupyter Notebook. Typically, this requires installing a
distribution that includes Jupyter and Python.

I recommend to use Anaconda, which is easy to install on Windows, Mac, and
Linux. Anaconda is a package manager, an environment manager, a Python distribution, a
collection of over 1,500+ open source packages, including Jupyter. It is free
to download, open source, and easy to install, on any computer system (Windows,
Mac OS X or Linux). It also includes the conda packaging utility to update and
install new packages of the Python, and to manage
computational environments. On the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) homepage you will
find all the information and files you need to install Anaconda.
The necessary Python packages can be easily installed via Anaconda.

The download button for notebooks
```
The CMS of Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin has set up a Jupyter-Hub that can be
accessed via your HU account. The server can be reached
[here](https://jupyterhub.cms.hu-berlin.de). To use the notebook, you must
first download the .ipynb file to your computer. To do this, use the download button in the
top menu (see {numref}`notebook_button`). Then you can upload the notebook to the local directory on the
Jupyter Hub server. 

(launch_env)= 
## Launch live Jupyter sessions

Launch buttons for interactive environments
```
You can launch live Jupyter sessions in the cloud directly from the notebook. This
let you quickly interact with the content in a traditional coding interface.
To launch the interactive environment click on the Launch Button at the top bar
(see {numref}`launch_button`).

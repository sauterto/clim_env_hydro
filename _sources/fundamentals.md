# Fundamentals 

## Exercises:

>**Exercise 1**:
Which stratification do the mixing layer, capping inversion, nocturnal bounday
layer, convective bounday layer and residual layer have? Assign the
stratification to the individual characteristic regions and briefly explain the
evoluation of the thermal stratification.

>**Exercise 2**:
>Large portions of the mixed layer and the residual layer have nearly adiabatic
>lapse rates. Nevertheless, there is a difference between the two. Comment on
>this difference. How would smoke disperse in these regions?

>**Exercise 3**:
>Would there be a boundary layer on a planet that had an atmosphere, but that
>did not experience a diurnal variation of net radiation at the ground?

>**Exercise 4**:
>Define the boundary layer in your own terms.

>**Exercise 5**:
>Explain why the potential virtual temperature is an important measure
>for the atmospheric boundary layer? What information could be used instead?

>**Exercise 6**:
>Given air at a pressure height of 870 hPa with a temperature of 28ºC and a
>mixing ration of 19 g/kg, find the virtual potential temperature.

>**Exercise 7**:
>You observe the following measurement of wind speed. What diameter (in meters)
>are the major eddies? (Hint: First find the typical time duration of an eddy,
>and then employ Taylor’s Hypothesis.)

**Exercise 8**:
Given the following virtual potential temperature sounding, identify each layer
(example, ML, RL, SBL, FA). Estimate what time of day that sounding was made
and then sketch the virtual potential temperature profile that you might expect
four hours later.

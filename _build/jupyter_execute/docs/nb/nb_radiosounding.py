# # Upper air analysis
# 
# Upper air analysis is fundamental for many synoptic and mesoscale analysis problems. In this tutorial we will gather weather balloon data from the  Integrated Global Radiosonde Archive (IGRA) database \[[link](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/weather-balloon/integrated-global-radiosonde-archive)\]. The database consists of radiosonde and pilot balloon observations from more than 2,800 globally distributed stations. Recent data become available in near real time from about 800 stations worldwide. Observations are available at standard and variable pressure levels, fixed and variable-height wind levels, and the surface and tropopause. Variables include pressure, temperature, geopotential height, relative humidity, dew point depression, wind direction and speed, and elapsed time since launch.
# 
# After we downloaded the data, we create a skew-T diagram, perform a series of thermodynamic calculations, and summarize the results.

# ## Thermodynamic Calculations
# 
# MetPy is a collection of tools in Python for reading, visualizing, and performing calculations with weather data  [[Link](https://unidata.github.io/MetPy/latest/index.html)]. Here, we use the MetPy calc module to calculate some thermodynamic parameters of the sounding.
# 
# **Lifting Condensation Level (LCL)** - The level at which an air parcelâ€™s relative humidity becomes 100% when lifted along a dry adiabatic path.
# 
# **Parcel Path** - Path followed by a hypothetical parcel of air, beginning at the surface temperature/pressure and rising dry adiabatically until reaching the LCL, then rising moist adiabatially.

# in Python for reading, visualizing, and performing calculations

# arrays must be reversed.

print('LCL pressure level: {:.2f}'.format(lcl_pressure))

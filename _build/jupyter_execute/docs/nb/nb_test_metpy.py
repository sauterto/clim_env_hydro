# # Getting started with MetPy

# Before we get started, we test the learning environment and the most important packages needed to run the notebooks. This is not so much a continuous coherent exercise as individual examples based on the different packages.This exercise is neither an introduction to Python nor extensive tutorials for the individual packages. I advise you, if you have little or no experience with the packages, to work through the relevant tutorial on the websites. All packages offer very good and extensive tutorials. Most of the functions presented here have been taken from these websites.

# MetPy is a collection of tools in Python for reading, visualizing, and performing calculations with weather data. One of the most significant differences in syntax for MetPy, compared to other Python libraries, is the frequent requirement of units to be attached to arrays before being passed to MetPy functions. There are very few exceptions to this, and youâ€™ll usually be safer to always use units whenever applicable to make sure that your analyses are done correctly. Once you get used to the units syntax, it becomes very handy, as you never have to worry about unit conversion for any calculation. MetPy does it for you!
# 
# Let's load the MetPy and numpy library
# 

# In[16]:


# Load the pandas package
import numpy as np
from metpy.units import units


# Please note, we have loaded only the units module here. We can assign a unit to an array by

# In[4]:


# Attach the unit meters to the distance array
distance = np.arange(1, 5) * units.meters


# Similarly, we can attach create a time array

# In[6]:


# This is another way to attach units to an array 
time = units.Quantity(np.arange(2, 10, 2), 'sec')


# Now, we can simply do unit-aware calculations

# In[7]:


distance/time


# ## MetPy with xarray

# In[8]:


import xarray as xr
import metpy
from metpy.cbook import get_test_data


# In[22]:


ds = xr.open_dataset(get_test_data('narr_example.nc', as_file_obj = False))
ds


# In[23]:


ds = ds.metpy.parse_cf()
ds


# In[24]:


# Grab lat/lon values from file as unit arrays
lats = ds.lat.metpy.unit_array
lons = ds.lon.metpy.unit_array

# Get the valid time
vtime = ds.Temperature.metpy.time[0]

# Get the 700-hPa heights without manually identifying the vertical coordinate
hght_700 = ds.Geopotential_height.metpy.sel(vertical=700 * units.hPa,
                                                 time=vtime)


# In[26]:


# Cartopy CRS, useful for plotting
hght_700.metpy.cartopy_crs


# In[47]:


import cartopy.crs as ccrs
import cartopy.feature as cfeature
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(12, 12))
ax = fig.add_subplot(1, 1, 1, projection=hght_700.metpy.cartopy_crs)
x = ds.x
y = ds.y

ax.imshow(hght_700, extent=(x.min(), x.max(), y.min(), y.max()),
          cmap='RdBu', origin='lower' if y[0] < y[-1] else 'upper')
ax.coastlines(color='tab:blue', resolution='10m')

plt.show()


# ## Calculations

# In[48]:


import numpy as np
from metpy.units import units
import metpy.calc as mpcalc


# In[49]:


temperature = [20] * units.degC
rel_humidity  = [50] * units.percent
print(mpcalc.dewpoint_from_relative_humidity(temperature, rel_humidity))


# In[54]:


speed = np.array([5, 10, 15, 20]) * units.knots
direction = np.array([0, 90, 180, 270]) * units.degrees
u, v = mpcalc.wind_components(speed, direction)
print(u, v)
